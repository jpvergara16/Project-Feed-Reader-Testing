# Project Overview

In this project, I implemented the [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) testing framework to incorporate multiple tests on a web-based application that reads RSS feeds, provided by [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com). These will test the underlying business logic of the application as well as the event handling and DOM manipulation.

## How to Run application

**Run the app locally by using terminal**:
```
git clone https://github.com/jpvergara16/Project-Nanodegree-Feed-Reader-Testing.git
```
* Open `feed-reader-testing` repository.
* Open `index.html` with your browser.
* There should be `8 specs, 0 failures` at the bottom of the html page.
